EMail Crawler
---------------------------------------------

- Requires python 3.x
- Requires BeautifulSoup library
  To install:
    apt-get install python3-bs4
    -or-
    pip3 install beautifulsoup4


This script supports extracting multiple email addresses in mailto links from multiple webpages on any number of supplied domains.
The page crawler is somewhat intelligent (it will skip assets like images, videos and documents as well as skipping offsite links.
It also normalizes links that don't have the FQDN in the href.

This doesn't parse javascript, so obfuscated emails are not detected. If I get any more spare time, I will see about adding that support.
You can also set a crawl rate (delay) and maximum number of pages.

Duplicate emails per domain are also stripped out. You're welcome :p

sample use:

python3 find_email_addresses.py --domains www.rapidtables.com/web/html/mailto.htm https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Email_links --delay 1 --maxpages 2 --outfile emails.txt

Checking http://www.rapidtables.com/web/html/mailto.htm for email addresses.
The following emails were found:
name3@rapidtables.com
name1@rapidtables.com
name@rapidtables.com
name2@rapidtables.com
Checking https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Email_links for email addresses.
The following emails were found:
nobody@mozilla.org
nowhere@mozilla.org

If you run into problems, enable debug mode by supplying --verbose on the command line
